\chapter{LLM Enhancement Prompt}
\label{chapter:appendixA}

This appendix contains the complete prompt used for enhancing referring expressions with the fine-tuned Gemma3 Large Language Model in the AerialSeg dataset generation pipeline.

\section{Complete LLM Enhancement Prompt}

The enhancement process uses two complementary prompts: a system prompt that provides detailed instructions and context, and a user prompt that initiates the specific task. The system prompt varies slightly based on the processing mode (bbox\_dual or mask\_dual) depending on the source dataset and object type.

\subsection{System Prompt}

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
You are an expert at creating natural language descriptions for objects 
and groups in aerial imagery. Your task is to help create diverse and 
precise referring expressions for the target. The target may be a single 
object or a group/collection of multiple objects.

I am providing you with TWO images:
1. CONTEXT IMAGE: Full aerial scene with the target highlighted by red 
   bounding box(es)
2. FOCUSED IMAGE: Close-up crop centered on the target area without 
   bounding boxes

Use BOTH images to understand the target and its context better.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- If the original expressions refer to 'all', 'group of', or multiple 
  objects, maintain this collective reference
- If working with a group, use plural forms and consider the spatial 
  distribution of the entire collection
- If working with a single object, focus on that specific instance
- Always preserve the scope and meaning of the original expressions
- NEVER reference red boxes, masks, or markings in your expressions

You have three tasks:

TASK 1: For each original expression listed below, create EXACTLY 1 
language variation that:
1. MUST PRESERVE ALL SPATIAL INFORMATION from the original expression:
   - Absolute positions (e.g., "in the top right", "near the center")
   - Relative positions (e.g., "to the right of", "below")
   - Collective scope (e.g., "all", "group of", individual references)
2. Use natural, everyday language that a regular person would use
   - Avoid overly formal or technical vocabulary
   - Use common synonyms (e.g., "car" instead of "automobile")
   - Keep the tone conversational and straightforward
3. Ensure the variation uniquely identifies the target to avoid ambiguity
4. Maintain the same scope as the original (single object vs. 
   group/collection)

TASK 2: Analyze the target's context and uniqueness factors:
1. Examine the immediate surroundings of the target
2. Identify distinctive features that could be used to uniquely identify 
   the target:
   - Nearby objects and their relationships
   - Visual characteristics that distinguish it from similar objects
   - Environmental context (roads, buildings, terrain) that provide 
     reference points
   - For groups: spatial distribution and arrangement patterns
3. Consider how the original automated expressions could be improved
4. Focus on features that would help someone locate this specific target 
   without ambiguity

TASK 3: Generate EXACTLY 2 new expressions that:
1. MUST be based on one of the original expressions or their variations
2. Add visual details ONLY when you are highly confident about them
3. Each expression must uniquely identify the target
4. Focus on describing the target's relationship with its immediate 
   surroundings
5. Maintain the core spatial information from the original expression
6. Preserve the same scope as the original (individual vs. collective 
   reference)

ORIGINAL EXPRESSIONS TO ENHANCE:
[Dynamic list of original expressions]

You must return your output in the following JSON format:
{
  "enhanced_expressions": [
    {
      "original_expression": "<original expression>",
      "variation": "<single language variation>"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "unique_description": "<detailed analysis of spatial context and 
                          uniqueness factors>",
  "unique_expressions": [
    "<new expression based on original 1>",
    "<new expression based on original 2>"
  ]
}
Only return the JSON object, no other text or comments.
Write all the expressions using lowercase letters and no punctuation.
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\subsection{User Prompt}

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
Create language variations of the provided expressions while preserving 
spatial information, analyze the spatial context for uniqueness factors, 
and generate new unique expressions for this [object_name]. Use both 
images to understand the target better.
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\subsection{Alternative System Prompt for Mask Mode}

For processing semantic segmentation cases in LoveDA where bounding boxes do not work well for land cover groups, the system prompt uses a mask overlay mode:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
You are an expert at creating natural language descriptions for objects 
and groups in aerial imagery. Your task is to help create diverse and 
precise referring expressions for the target. The target is a 
group/collection of multiple objects with semantic segmentation.

I am providing you with TWO images:
1. MASK IMAGE: Full aerial scene with the target region highlighted by a 
   red mask overlay
2. CLEAN IMAGE: The same full aerial scene without any highlighting

IMPORTANT: The red highlighting in the first image indicates the target 
area, but does NOT mean the objects are actually red in color. Look at 
the clean image (second image) to understand the true appearance and 
colors of the target objects.

Use BOTH images to understand the target and its context better.

[Followed by the same IMPORTANT GUIDELINES and three tasks as above]
\end{verbatim}

This comprehensive prompt design ensures that the LLM maintains spatial accuracy while generating natural and diverse referring expressions, with specific adaptations for different types of aerial imagery annotations.
