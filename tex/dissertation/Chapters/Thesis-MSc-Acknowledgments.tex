I would like to thank my parents for their friendship, encouragement and caring over all these years, for always being there for me through thick and thin and without whom this project would not be possible.

I would like to express my gratitude to my dissertation supervisors Prof. Bruno Martins and Prof. Alexandre Bernardino for their guidance, expertise, and invaluable knowledge sharing that enabled the completion of this thesis. Their mentorship has been instrumental in shaping this research.

Finally, I am grateful to my friends for their unwavering belief in me and for always being there during both good and challenging times.

To each and every one of you -- Thank you.
