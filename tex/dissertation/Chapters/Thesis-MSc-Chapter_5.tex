Having constructed the Aerial-D dataset in the previous chapter, we now proceed to demonstrate its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on referring segmentation models. We evaluate how our dataset performs when combined with other aerial benchmarks, examine the contribution of different expression types, and compare various large language model configurations for annotation enhancement. The experiments use the RSRefSeg backbone as our primary architecture and include thorough ablation studies to isolate the impact of each component.

\section{Model Architecture}

In order to evaluate language-guided segmentation in aerial imagery, we require a model that can interpret free-form expressions while preserving pixel-level precision. Generic segmentation systems usually break down under the remote-sensing domain shift: objects are small, visually repetitive, and densely packed, making it difficult for architectures that were tuned for ground-level imagery. We therefore adopt RSRefSeg as our backbone because it couples a strong multimodal encoder with a high-capacity mask decoder, allowing the model to ground language descriptions even when training data is scarce.

Concretely, we implement RSRefSeg in PyTorch~\cite{pytorch} following the design shown earlier in Figure~\ref{fig:rsrefseg_architecture}. SigLIP2 supplies the joint language--image encoder, SAM provides the segmentation decoder, and LoRA adapters~\cite{lora} are inserted into the query and value projections of both backbones as well as the text encoder projections~\cite{siglip2,sam,chen2025rsrefseg}. The model is not fine-tuned for aerial imagery out of the box; instead, the LoRA matrices are what we train to adapt the pre-trained components to the aerial domain, as demonstrated in the original RSRefSeg work. This includes training the attention prompter component that helps bridge the gap between natural language descriptions and aerial scene understanding.

\section{Experimental Setup}

To produce reliable comparisons across datasets we standardize the training recipe around a moderate batch size and carefully tuned optimization settings. Large batches are impractical on the available hardware, so we use mini-batches of four images and accumulate gradients over two steps to emulate an effective batch of eight. Training runs with mixed precision, the AdamW optimizer~\cite{adamw} with an initial learning rate of $1\times 10^{-4}$, weight decay of $0.01$, polynomial decay with power $0.9$, and gradient clipping at $1.0$ to keep updates stable. The model combines the \texttt{SigLIP2-SO400M} encoder with \texttt{SAM-ViT-Base}~\cite{siglip2,sam}, ensuring that the language and vision components remain aligned despite their different native resolutions; images are therefore resized to $384\times384$ for SigLIP2 and $1024\times1024$ for SAM.

The experiments also need a balanced training mix that prevents Aerial-D from overwhelming other corpora while still exposing the model to the dataset's richer expressions. We therefore train a single combined model on Aerial-D (restricted to the Unique Expressions Only split), RRSIS-D, NWPU-Refer, RefSegRS, and Urban1960SatSeg~\cite{yuan2023rrsis,yang2024large,hao2025urban1960satseg}. The choice of the Unique Only set is deliberate: we aim to avoid overwhelming the other datasets with the sheer volume of Aerial-D expressions while focusing on the most discriminative annotations. As shown in our ablation studies, the Unique Expressions contain substantial signal and demonstrate strong generalization capability when used to train models that perform well across different datasets. For the four datasets that originate from contemporary imagery we inject the historic-filter augmentations described in Section~\ref{subsec:historic_filters}: twenty percent of training images are randomly replaced with a grayscale, sepia, or film-grain variant so the model repeatedly encounters archival degradations during learning. Evaluation uses the native validation split for each dataset, plus historic-filtered copies that transform one hundred percent of the validation images; these appear in the tables under the ``Hist.'' columns.

% #############################################################################
\section{Cross-Dataset Evaluation}

Our main experiment addresses whether a single combined model can generalize across diverse aerial benchmarks while withstanding historic degradations. We begin our experimentation by training a single model on all five datasets while testing it on all of them. Tables~\ref{tab:aeriald_variants} and \ref{tab:combined_training_results} report the validation metrics for this run, emphasizing mean IoU and overall IoU for both the original validation split and the historic-filtered counterpart.

Table~\ref{tab:aeriald_variants} isolates Aerial-D and breaks the evaluation down by supervision type. The instance-only view concentrates on explicit object targets, the semantic configuration considers land-cover regions, and the combined variant merges both sources to capture the full dataset. Rows list the two checkpoints we trained—RSRefSeg-b and the larger RSRefSeg-l—with the latter awaiting full evaluation, hence the placeholder entries.

Across the external benchmarks in Table~\ref{tab:combined_training_results}, the RSRefSeg-b checkpoint maintains strong performance. On RRSIS-D we measure 64.37\% mIoU and 76.83\% oIoU, with the historic split retaining \textcolor{blue}{61.16\%} and \textcolor{blue}{75.44\%}. NWPU-Refer records 39.42\% mIoU and 59.52\% oIoU, dropping to \textcolor{blue}{33.15\%} and \textcolor{blue}{56.56\%} under filters. RefSegRS lands at 24.81\% mIoU and 40.89\% oIoU, tapering to \textcolor{blue}{17.54\%} and \textcolor{blue}{29.41\%} on its historic counterpart. Urban1960SatSeg, already composed of archival imagery, posts 70.65\% mIoU and 88.86\% oIoU. These scores match or surpass previously reported baselines across the public datasets while defining reference values for Aerial-D. We therefore include both RSRefSeg-b and RSRefSeg-l in the comparison, now reporting the freshly evaluated metrics for the large checkpoint alongside the base variant.

The model therefore achieves comparable results to previously reported baselines on every public benchmark while simultaneously defining reference numbers for Aerial-D. The narrow gap between original and historic evaluations shows that the augmentation strategy meaningfully improves robustness without sacrificing accuracy on contemporary imagery, and the pending RSRefSeg-l run will extend this comparison once metrics are available.

\section{Ablation Studies}

To better understand the contribution of each component in our approach, we conduct a series of targeted ablation studies. These experiments systematically isolate the effects of different expression types, language model choices, and training augmentations. The first ablation examines how rule-based versus LLM-enhanced expressions affect performance across datasets. The second study compares different language models in the enhancement pipeline, evaluating both quality and computational cost. Finally, we assess the impact of historic filter augmentations on model robustness when dealing with archival imagery.

\subsection{Expression Enhancement Ablation}

In order to isolate how each expression type contributes to performance we rerun training on controlled subsets of Aerial-D. The combined model mixes rule-based sentences with two LLM-enhanced variants, which makes it difficult to attribute gains to any single source. We therefore train four RSRefSeg models using the same architecture—rule-based only, enhanced only, unique expressions only, and a combined run—to understand how much signal each subset contributes to model performance.

Each checkpoint is evaluated on the Aerial-D validation split and on three external datasets without additional fine-tuning. Table~\ref{tab:ablation_expression_types} lists the number of samples processed, the number of epochs completed, and the resulting mIoU/oIoU scores. The combined configuration unsurprisingly wins on Aerial-D with 49.33\% mIoU and 64.30\% oIoU, mirroring the validation distribution. However, the specialized subsets generalize best elsewhere: the language-focused Enhanced Only model reaches 41.63\% mIoU and 42.48\% oIoU on RRSIS-D, while the visually grounded Unique Expressions Only split delivers 24.68\% mIoU and 29.22\% oIoU on NWPU-Refer. RefSegRS benefits from combining language and visual cues, with the combined run nudging ahead of the others.

We monitor validation loss for each run and stop as soon as it rebounds, leading to two epochs for the much larger combined subset and four epochs for the smaller splits. Although the specialized models see fewer total samples, they often outperform the full mixture on external benchmarks, confirming that targeted expression diversity is more valuable than sheer volume. This result directly motivates using the unique-only slice when mixing Aerial-D with other datasets in the combined training experiments.

\subsection{Distillation Ablation: Gemma3 vs. o3 Model Comparison}

Recall from Chapter~\ref{chap:implement} that the LLM enhancement phase allows us to transform rule-based expressions into more natural, diverse referring expressions using large language models. This component of the pipeline gives us the flexibility to choose different LLM architectures depending on quality requirements and computational constraints. To understand how this choice affects both annotation quality and practical deployment considerations, we conduct an ablation study comparing different language models within the enhancement pipeline.

We also need to understand how the choice of language model inside the enhancement pipeline affects annotation quality and operating cost. Using o3 for every expression yields high-quality rewrites but is prohibitively expensive, while the off-the-shelf Gemma3-12B often hallucinates objects and locations that are absent from the imagery. To reconcile quality and cost, we distill o3 outputs~\cite{o3} into the Gemma3-Aerial model introduced in Chapter~\ref{chap:implement}~\cite{gemma3}, keeping the same prompting and decoding strategy across all generators. Fine-tuning uses QLoRA~\cite{qlora}, and large-scale inference runs efficiently with vLLM~\cite{vllm}.

Figure~\ref{fig:distillation_comparison} shows the qualitative effect: the base Gemma3 description invents a second baseball diamond, whereas the distilled model matches the grounded detail of the o3 response. Table~\ref{tab:cost_comparison} quantifies the economics. Processing roughly 300{,}000 targets with o3 would cost \$6{,}218.32, while the distilled Gemma3 executes locally for \$26.01—about 238× cheaper—because the o3 model is much larger and requires significantly more computational resources to run compared to Gemma3. The saving is large enough to make multi-pass enhancements feasible even on academic budgets.

These findings confirm that distillation transfers both linguistic fidelity and grounding accuracy while drastically lowering the marginal cost of annotation. The distilled model therefore underpins all large-scale expression generation throughout the project.

\end{table}

The cost calculations are based on current API pricing: o3 costs \$2.00 per million input tokens and \$8.00 per million output tokens on the OpenAI API platform, while Gemma3-12B costs \$0.035 per million input tokens and \$0.141 per million output tokens through the OpenRouter inference provider. The average tokens per request are 1,670.8 input and 2,173.3 output for o3, compared to 1,330.0 input and 284.7 output for Gemma3, calculated based on 15 sample requests.

\subsection{Historic Filter Ablation Study}

Finally, we evaluate how much the historic-filter augmentation contributes to robustness by retraining the combined model without injecting filtered images. Models trained solely on clean, contemporary imagery often falter when archival photographs introduce monochrome toning, contrast loss, or sepia casts. Removing the filters exposes whether robustness stems from the augmentation or from dataset diversity alone.

Table~\ref{tab:historic_ablation_results} reports the outcome using the same metric format as the combined evaluation. Without filter injections the model gains a few points on the clean validation splits—for instance RRSIS-D climbs to 64.36\% mIoU—but it loses resilience on the historic versions. RefSegRS suffers the most, dropping from \textcolor{blue}{32.79\%} to \textcolor{blue}{27.73\%} mIoU and from \textcolor{blue}{36.74\%} to \textcolor{blue}{32.21\%} oIoU when confronted with filtered validation imagery. The Aerial-D and NWPU-Refer historic splits also shed several points, illustrating that the augmentation specifically protects datasets whose semantics depend on subtle colour and contrast cues.

These results confirm that modest exposure to historic degradations during training is enough to stabilise performance when evaluation imagery undergoes the same transformations. We therefore keep the filter injections in the final combined recipe despite the small trade-off in clean-split accuracy.

\end{table}

Collectively, the updated experiments demonstrate that the Aerial-D dataset, RSRefSeg backbone, and LLM-enhanced expressions form a cohesive system that generalises across aerial benchmarks, withstands historic degradations, and remains economically scalable. These results ground the dissertation's claims with the most recent evidence and align the thesis with the accompanying article.
