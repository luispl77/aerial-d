\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work introduces Aerial\mbox{-}D together with an end-to-end methodology that converts existing aerial segmentation datasets into a large-scale repository of referring expressions. We begin with a rule-driven generator that transforms instance masks into language by describing location, appearance, and relational cues, then expand that phrasing through LLM rewriting and the distilled Gemma3 annotator so the pipeline remains affordable. The resulting corpus supports combined training of RSRefSeg across five benchmarks and yields new baselines on Aerial\mbox{-}D while matching or surpassing published results on RRSIS-D, NWPU-Refer, RefSegRS, and Urban1960SatSeg. Ablation studies on expression sources and historic-image filters further show how enhanced language and domain-specific augmentations translate into measurable gains in robustness.

Future work can extend this foundation in three directions. First, the expression-enhancement pipeline can be applied directly to the native captions supplied with public benchmarks such as RRSIS-D and NWPU-Refer, enriching their language with the same visual grounding cues that proved effective for Aerial\mbox{-}D and creating a unified, higher-variety training pool. Second, multilingual variants of these expressions can be produced by pairing o3 with our distillation pipeline so that o3 drafts high-quality translations and the Gemma3 student learns to reproduce them at scale, preserving domain-specific phrasing and producing a high-quality multilingual corpus. Third, emerging multimodal systems such as GeminiÂ 2.5\cite{gemini25} already emit pixel-level masks via text prompts; integrating them into the pipeline would allow us to synthesize new object classes and segmentation masks alongside the accompanying expressions. Those machine-generated masks could then be refined with the same expression-generation stages, opening a path toward fully synthetic, open-vocabulary aerial datasets.
